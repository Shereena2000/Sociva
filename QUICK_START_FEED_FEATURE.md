## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: No posts in "For You" tab**
**Solution**: 
- Create posts with "Feed" selected (not "Home")
- Old posts have `postType = 'home'` by default

### **Issue: "Following" tab empty**
**Solution**:
- Follow some users first
- Those users need to create "Feed" posts
- If you don't follow anyone, this tab will be empty

### **Issue: Post appears in wrong screen**
**Solution**:
- Check which button was selected when creating
- Blue button = selected destination
- "Home" = Home screen
- "Feed" = Feed screen

### **Issue: Loading forever**
**Solution**:
- Check internet connection
- Check Firebase rules are updated
- Check console for errors
