# Firebase Security Rules - Complete Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Why Your Current Rules Are Dangerous

Your current rules:
```javascript
match /{document=**} {
  allow read, write: if request.time < timestamp.date(2025, 11, 15);
}
```

### Problems:
1. ‚ùå **Anyone can read ALL data** - even without logging in (after the time check)
2. ‚ùå **Anyone can modify/delete ANY user's data**
3. ‚ùå **Users can delete other people's posts**
4. ‚ùå **Users can modify follower counts arbitrarily**
5. ‚ùå **No data validation** - users can create malformed data
6. ‚ùå **No privacy protection** - all user data exposed
7. ‚ùå **Users can impersonate others** by creating posts with someone else's userId

## ‚úÖ What the New Rules Protect

### 1. **Users Collection** (`/users/{userId}`)
- ‚úÖ Only authenticated users can see profiles
- ‚úÖ Users can only create/edit their own profile
- ‚úÖ System can update follower/following counts (for follow feature)
- ‚úÖ Validates user owns the profile they're editing

### 2. **Posts Collection** (`/posts/{postId}`)
- ‚úÖ Only authenticated users can see posts
- ‚úÖ Users can only create posts with their own userId
- ‚úÖ Users can only delete their own posts
- ‚úÖ Anyone can like/unlike posts (updates likes array)
- ‚úÖ System can update comment counts
- ‚úÖ Validates post structure on creation

### 3. **Comments Collection** (`/comments/{commentId}`)
- ‚úÖ Only authenticated users can see/create comments
- ‚úÖ Users can only create comments with their own userId
- ‚úÖ Users can only delete their own comments
- ‚úÖ System can update reply counts
- ‚úÖ Validates comment structure

### 4. **Statuses Collection** (`/statuses/{statusId}`)
- ‚úÖ Only authenticated users can see statuses
- ‚úÖ Users can only create/delete their own statuses
- ‚úÖ Validates status structure (24-hour expiry)

### 5. **Follows Collection** (`/follows/{followId}`)
- ‚úÖ Only authenticated users can see follow relationships
- ‚úÖ Users can only follow as themselves (not impersonate)
- ‚úÖ Users cannot follow themselves
- ‚úÖ Document ID must match pattern: `{followerId}_{followingId}`
- ‚úÖ Users can only unfollow relationships they created

### 6. **Status Views Collection** (`/statusViews/{viewerId}`)
- ‚úÖ Users can only track their own status views
- ‚úÖ Privacy protected - can't see what others viewed

## üöÄ How to Apply These Rules

### Method 1: Firebase Console (Recommended)

1. **Go to Firebase Console**
   - Visit: https://console.firebase.google.com/
   - Select your project

2. **Navigate to Firestore Database**
   - Click "Firestore Database" in left menu
   - Click "Rules" tab at the top

3. **Replace Rules**
   - Delete all existing rules
   - Copy the content from `firestore.rules` file
   - Click "Publish"

4. **Test Rules**
   - Use the "Rules Playground" to test scenarios

### Method 2: Firebase CLI

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI if not installed
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize Firebase in your project (if not done)
firebase init firestore

# Deploy rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## üß™ Testing Your Rules

### Test Scenarios:

#### ‚úÖ Test 1: User Can Create Their Own Post
```javascript
// Should SUCCEED
User A creates post with userId = A
```

#### ‚ùå Test 2: User Cannot Create Post as Another User
```javascript
// Should FAIL
User A creates post with userId = B
```

#### ‚úÖ Test 3: User Can Delete Their Own Post
```javascript
// Should SUCCEED
User A deletes post created by User A
```

#### ‚ùå Test 4: User Cannot Delete Another's Post
```javascript
// Should FAIL
User A tries to delete post created by User B
```

#### ‚úÖ Test 5: User Can Follow Another User
```javascript
// Should SUCCEED
User A follows User B (creates follows/A_B)
```

#### ‚ùå Test 6: User Cannot Follow as Someone Else
```javascript
// Should FAIL
User A tries to create follows/B_C (impersonation)
```

#### ‚úÖ Test 7: Anyone Can Like a Post
```javascript
// Should SUCCEED
User A likes User B's post
```

#### ‚ùå Test 8: User Cannot Arbitrarily Change Follower Counts
```javascript
// Should FAIL
User A tries to set their followersCount to 1000000
```

## üìä Rule Breakdown by Collection

### Users Collection Rules Explained:

```javascript
allow read: if request.auth != null;
// ‚úì Any logged-in user can read profiles
// ‚úó Unauthenticated users cannot

allow create: if request.auth != null 
  && request.auth.uid == userId
  && request.resource.data.uid == userId;
// ‚úì Users can create their own profile
// ‚úó Cannot create profile for someone else

allow update: if request.auth != null && (
  request.auth.uid == userId
  || request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys()
     .hasOnly(['followersCount', 'followingCount'])
);
// ‚úì Users can update their own profile
// ‚úì System can update ONLY follower counts (for follow feature)
// ‚úó Cannot update someone else's profile
```

### Posts Collection Rules Explained:

```javascript
allow create: if request.auth != null 
  && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId
  && request.resource.data.keys().hasAll([...])
  && request.resource.data.likeCount == 0
  && request.resource.data.commentCount == 0;
// ‚úì Must be authenticated
// ‚úì Must create post with your own userId
// ‚úì Must include required fields
// ‚úì Must start with 0 likes and 0 comments
```

### Follows Collection Rules Explained:

```javascript
allow create: if request.auth != null 
  && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.followerId
  && followId == request.auth.uid + '_' + request.resource.data.followingId
  && request.resource.data.followerId != request.resource.data.followingId;
// ‚úì Must be authenticated
// ‚úì You must be the follower (can't follow as someone else)
// ‚úì Document ID must match pattern: {yourId}_{theirId}
// ‚úì Cannot follow yourself
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Authentication Required**: All operations require authentication
2. **Ownership Validation**: Users can only modify their own data
3. **Data Structure Validation**: Required fields must be present
4. **Prevent Impersonation**: Can't create data as another user
5. **Selective Updates**: Specific fields can be updated by system (counts)
6. **No Arbitrary Count Changes**: Counts only change through proper flows

## üîç How to Monitor Security

### Check for Unauthorized Access:

1. **Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí Usage Tab**
   - Monitor read/write operations
   - Check for unusual patterns

2. **Enable Security Rules Logging**
   - Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí Rules
   - Click "Simulate" to test scenarios

3. **Monitor Auth Activity**
   - Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Users
   - Check for suspicious accounts

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Errors & Solutions

### Error: "Missing or insufficient permissions"
**Cause**: User trying to access data they don't have permission for  
**Solution**: This is working correctly - check if operation should be allowed

### Error: "Document does not match required structure"
**Cause**: Creating document without required fields  
**Solution**: Ensure all required fields are included in document creation

### Error: "Cannot follow yourself"
**Cause**: Trying to create follow relationship where followerId == followingId  
**Solution**: This is prevented by design - working correctly

## üìù Maintenance

### When Adding New Features:

1. **Identify new collections** you'll create
2. **Define who can read/write** that data
3. **Add validation rules** for data structure
4. **Test thoroughly** before deploying

### Regular Security Audits:

- Review rules every 3-6 months
- Check for new security best practices
- Update rules as features change
- Test edge cases

## üéØ Summary

Your **new rules** provide:
- ‚úÖ **Authentication required** for all operations
- ‚úÖ **Data ownership validation** 
- ‚úÖ **Privacy protection**
- ‚úÖ **Prevent data manipulation**
- ‚úÖ **Structured data validation**
- ‚úÖ **Secure follow/unfollow system**
- ‚úÖ **Protected user profiles**
- ‚úÖ **Secure posts and comments**

Your **old rules** had:
- ‚ùå No authentication requirement
- ‚ùå Anyone can modify anything
- ‚ùå No privacy
- ‚ùå No validation
- ‚ùå Security risk until expiry date

## üö® IMPORTANT: Deploy Now!

**Replace your current rules immediately** to protect your users' data!
