# PageView Swipe and Image Loading Fix

## Problem
User reported that when viewing a saved feed with multiple images:
- Second image tries to load but swiping doesn't work well
- Images don't show properly when swiping

## Changes Made

### 1. Improved PageView Physics
**File:** `lib/Features/post/view/post_detail_screen.dart`

Added `BouncingScrollPhysics` to the PageView for better, more responsive swipe behavior:

```dart
PageView.builder(
  controller: _pageController,
  physics: const BouncingScrollPhysics(), // Better scrolling physics
  ...
)
```

### 2. Simplified Image Widget Structure
Removed unnecessary Container wrappers and used direct `Image.network` with proper keys:

**Before:**
```dart
return Container(
  child: Center(
    child: Image.network(...),
  ),
);
```

**After:**
```dart
return Image.network(
  mediaUrl,
  key: ValueKey('img_${index}_${mediaUrl.hashCode}'),
  fit: BoxFit.cover,
  ...
);
```

### 3. Added Comprehensive Debug Logging
Added detailed logging to track:
- When the widget builds and how many media URLs are present
- When pages change
- When images are loading (with progress percentage)
- When images load successfully
- When images fail to load (with error details)

Debug output will look like:
```
🖼️ Building PostDetailScreen:
   Media URLs count: 2
   Current page: 0
   Media 0: ...uqfkyf61rldn1zvhp8ic.jpg
   Media 1: ...ooj5lanqgifqblbpw93n.jpg
   🏗️ Building image at index 0
   ⏳ Image 0 loading... 45%
   ✅ Image 0 loaded successfully
   🏗️ Building image at index 1
   ⏳ Image 1 loading... 30%
   ✅ Image 1 loaded successfully
📄 Page changed to: 1
```

### 4. Better Loading States
Added loading progress indicators that show:
- Which image is loading (e.g., "Loading image 2 of 2")
- Loading progress (if available from network)
- Visual progress indicator

### 5. Better Error Handling
If an image fails to load, it now shows:
- Broken image icon
- Error message with image number
- "Tap to retry" hint
- Full error details in console

### 6. Unique Keys for Each Image
Each image now has a unique key based on both its index AND URL hash:
```dart
key: ValueKey('img_${index}_${mediaUrl.hashCode}')
```

This ensures Flutter treats each image as a completely separate widget, preventing caching issues.

## How to Test

1. **Run the app** (hot restart recommended)
2. **Navigate to:** Menu → Saved Feeds
3. **Tap on a saved feed** with 2 photos
4. **Watch the console** for debug output
5. **Try swiping** left and right between images
6. **Check the page indicators** at the top (white dots showing which page you're on)

## What to Look For

### In the Console:
1. Do you see "Building PostDetailScreen" with 2 media URLs?
2. Do you see both images being built?
3. Do you see loading progress messages?
4. When you swipe, do you see "Page changed to: 1"?
5. Are there any error messages?

### On Screen:
1. Can you see the first image?
2. When you swipe, do the page indicators (dots) change?
3. Does the second image load?
4. Can you swipe back and forth smoothly?

## Possible Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Swipe works but image doesn't show
**Symptoms:** Page indicators change, but you see a loading spinner or broken image
**Cause:** Network issue loading the image
**Solution:** Check the error message in console - might be a network connectivity issue or bad image URL

### Issue 2: Can't swipe at all
**Symptoms:** Nothing happens when you swipe, page indicators don't change
**Cause:** Gesture conflict with overlays
**Debug:** Check console - do you see "Page changed to:" messages when you swipe?

### Issue 3: Same image shows on both pages
**Symptoms:** Both pages show the same image
**Cause:** The unique keys aren't working as expected
**Debug:** Check console - are the two media URLs actually different?

## Expected Console Output

When working correctly, you should see something like:

```
🖼️ Building PostDetailScreen:
   Media URLs count: 2
   Current page: 0
   Media 0: uqfkyf61rldn1zvhp8ic.jpg
   Media 1: ooj5lanqgifqblbpw93n.jpg
   🏗️ Building image at index 0
   ✅ Image 0 loaded successfully
   🏗️ Building image at index 1
   ⏳ Image 1 loading... 100%
   ✅ Image 1 loaded successfully
[User swipes]
📄 Page changed to: 1
```

## Next Steps

1. Test the app and share the console output
2. Let me know:
   - Can you swipe? (Do the dots change?)
   - Do images load? (Do you see both different images?)
   - Any error messages in console?

Based on the console output, I can provide targeted fixes if needed.
