# Saved Feed - Duplicate Image and Permission Issues - FIXED âœ…

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Permission Denied Error
**File:** `lib/Features/menu/saved_feed/repository/saved_feed_repository.dart`

**Problem:** The repository was trying to access a `feeds` collection that doesn't exist in Firestore.

**Solution:** Changed to use the `posts` collection (line 61).

**Before:**
```dart
final feedDoc = await _firestore.collection('feeds').doc(savedFeed.feedId).get();
```

**After:**
```dart
final feedDoc = await _firestore.collection('posts').doc(savedFeed.feedId).get();
```

### 2. âœ… Duplicate Image Issue (Image Caching Problem)
**File:** `lib/Features/post/view/post_detail_screen.dart`

**Problem:** When swiping through multiple images in a saved feed, Flutter's Image.network widget was showing the same cached image for all pages in the PageView.

**Solution:** Added unique `ValueKey` to each Container and Image.network widget to force Flutter to recognize them as different widgets.

**Changes Made:**
```dart
// Added key to Container (line 142)
return Container(
  key: ValueKey('media_${index}_$mediaUrl'), // Unique key for each media item
  width: double.infinity,
  height: double.infinity,
  child: isVideo
      ? VideoPlayerWidget(...)
      : Image.network(
          mediaUrl,
          key: ValueKey(mediaUrl), // Unique key for each image (line 156)
          fit: BoxFit.cover,
          ...
        ),
);
```

**Why This Works:**
- Flutter uses keys to identify widgets in the widget tree
- Without keys, Flutter may reuse the same widget for different pages
- By providing a unique key for each image URL, Flutter creates a new Image widget for each page
- This prevents the image caching issue where the same image appears on multiple pages

### 3. âœ… SavedFeedViewModel Disposal Error
**File:** `lib/Features/menu/saved_feed/view_model/saved_feed_view_model.dart`

**Problem:** The ViewModel was listening to a Firestore stream but never canceling the subscription when disposed, causing "A SavedFeedViewModel was used after being disposed" errors.

**Solution:** Properly manage the StreamSubscription lifecycle:

**Changes Made:**

1. **Added StreamSubscription and disposal flag:**
```dart
StreamSubscription<List<Map<String, dynamic>>>? _savedFeedsSubscription;
bool _isDisposed = false;
```

2. **Store and check subscription in constructor:**
```dart
SavedFeedViewModel() {
  _savedFeedsSubscription = _savedFeedRepository.getSavedFeeds().listen((feeds) {
    if (!_isDisposed) {
      _savedFeeds = feeds;
      notifyListeners();
    }
  }, onError: (error) {
    if (!_isDisposed) {
      _errorMessage = 'Failed to load saved feeds: $error';
      notifyListeners();
    }
  });
}
```

3. **Properly dispose subscription:**
```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  _isDisposed = true;
  _savedFeedsSubscription?.cancel();
  super.dispose();
}
```

4. **Added disposal checks to all methods:**
```dart
Future<void> loadSavedFeeds() async {
  if (_isDisposed) return;
  // ... rest of method
}

Future<void> unsaveFeed(String feedId) async {
  if (_isDisposed) return;
  // ... rest of method
}
```

## Testing the Fixes

### Test 1: Saved Feed Functionality
1. âœ… Navigate to Menu â†’ Saved Feeds
2. âœ… View saved feeds without permission errors
3. âœ… Tap on a saved feed with multiple images

### Test 2: Image Swiping
1. âœ… Open a saved feed with 2+ images
2. âœ… Swipe left/right through images
3. âœ… Verify each image is different (not the same cached image)

### Test 3: Navigation Stability
1. âœ… Navigate to saved feed detail
2. âœ… Navigate back to saved feed list
3. âœ… No disposal errors in console
4. âœ… App remains stable

## What Was Happening (Root Cause Analysis)

### Image Caching Issue
Flutter's Image.network widget caches images based on the URL. When using PageView without unique keys:
- Page 0 loads image with URL1
- Flutter caches this widget
- Page 1 tries to load image with URL2
- But Flutter reuses the cached widget from Page 0
- Result: Same image appears on both pages

**Solution:** Unique keys force Flutter to create separate widget instances.

### ViewModel Disposal Issue
When navigating from SavedFeedScreen to PostDetailScreen:
- SavedFeedScreen's ChangeNotifierProvider disposes the ViewModel
- But the Firestore stream subscription continues running
- Stream tries to call `notifyListeners()` on disposed ViewModel
- Result: "ViewModel was used after being disposed" error

**Solution:** Cancel subscription when disposing and check disposal state before notifying listeners.

## Files Modified

1. `lib/Features/menu/saved_feed/repository/saved_feed_repository.dart`
   - Changed `feeds` collection to `posts` collection

2. `lib/Features/post/view/post_detail_screen.dart`
   - Added `ValueKey` to Container and Image.network widgets

3. `lib/Features/menu/saved_feed/view_model/saved_feed_view_model.dart`
   - Added StreamSubscription management
   - Added disposal checks
   - Properly cancel subscription on dispose

---

## No Changes Needed

Your Firestore rules are **correct** and already include the `savedFeeds` collection:

```javascript
match /savedFeeds/{savedFeedId} {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated();
  allow create: if isAuthenticated() && 
    request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
  allow delete: if isAuthenticated() && 
    resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
}
```

## Verification

Run the app and verify:
- âœ… No permission denied errors
- âœ… Multiple images display correctly when swiping
- âœ… No disposal errors in console
- âœ… Smooth navigation between screens

All issues should now be resolved! ðŸŽ‰
