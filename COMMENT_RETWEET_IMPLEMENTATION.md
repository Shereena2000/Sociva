# Comment Retweet Implementation

## Overview
Implemented comment retweet functionality that allows users to retweet comments, which then appear as feed posts on the feed screen.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated TwitterCommentRepository (`lib/Features/feed/repository/twitter_comment_repository.dart`)
- Modified `toggleRetweet()` method to create feed posts when comments are retweeted
- Added `_createRetweetPostInFeed()` method to create new posts in the feed collection
- Added `_removeRetweetPostFromFeed()` method to remove retweet posts when unretweeting
- Comment retweets are stored as regular feed posts with special flags:
  - `isRetweetedComment: true`
  - `retweetedCommentId: commentId`
  - `retweetedCommentData: commentData`
  - `originalPostId: postId`

### 2. Updated PostModel (`lib/Features/post/model/post_model.dart`)
- Added new fields to support comment retweets:
  - `isRetweetedComment: bool`
  - `retweetedCommentId: String?`
  - `retweetedCommentData: Map<String, dynamic>?`
  - `originalPostId: String?`
- Added getter `isCommentRetweet` to check if post is a retweeted comment
- Updated `toMap()`, `fromMap()`, and `copyWith()` methods

### 3. Updated FollowingWidget (`lib/Features/feed/view/widgets/following_widget.dart`)
- Added `_buildCommentRetweetHeader()` method for comment retweet headers
- Added `_buildCommentRetweetPreview()` method to display retweeted comment content
- Updated `_buildPostCard()` to handle comment retweets
- Comment retweets show:
  - "Username retweeted a comment" header
  - Preview of the original comment with author info and content
  - Support for comment media (images/videos)

### 4. Updated ForYouWidget (`lib/Features/feed/view/widgets/for_you_widget.dart`)
- Added same comment retweet functionality as FollowingWidget
- Consistent UI/UX across both feed tabs

## How It Works

1. **User clicks retweet on a comment**: The retweet button in the comment widget triggers the retweet action
2. **Comment retweet is processed**: The `toggleRetweet()` method in TwitterCommentRepository:
   - Adds user ID to comment's retweets array
   - Creates a new feed post with comment data
   - Sets special flags to identify it as a comment retweet
3. **Feed post appears**: The new post appears in both Following and For You feeds
4. **Display shows context**: The feed post shows:
   - "Username retweeted a comment" header
   - Preview of the original comment
   - Original comment author's profile info
   - Comment text and media (if any)

## Database Structure

### Comment Retweet Post Document
```json
{
  "postId": "timestamp",
  "mediaUrl": "",
  "mediaUrls": [],
  "mediaType": "text",
  "caption": "",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "userId": "retweeter_user_id",
  "userName": "Retweeter Name",
  "username": "retweeter_username",
  "userProfilePhoto": "profile_url",
  "isVerified": false,
  "likes": [],
  "commentCount": 0,
  "retweets": [],
  "postType": "feed",
  "viewCount": 0,
  "isRetweetedComment": true,
  "retweetedCommentId": "original_comment_id",
  "retweetedCommentData": {
    "commentId": "original_comment_id",
    "text": "comment text",
    "userId": "comment_author_id",
    "userName": "Comment Author",
    "username": "comment_author_username",
    "mediaUrls": ["media_urls"],
    "mediaType": "text/image/video",
    // ... other comment fields
  },
  "originalPostId": "original_post_id"
}
```

## Features

- ✅ Retweet comments from comment detail screen
- ✅ Retweeted comments appear as feed posts
- ✅ Show retweet header with retweeter info
- ✅ Display original comment preview
- ✅ Support for comment media (images/videos)
- ✅ Unretweet functionality removes feed post
- ✅ Consistent UI across Following and For You feeds
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging

## Testing

To test the functionality:
1. Navigate to any post with comments
2. Click on a comment to view comment detail screen
3. Click the retweet button on any comment
4. Go back to feed screen
5. The retweeted comment should appear as a feed post
6. Click retweet again to unretweet and remove from feed

## Notes

- Comment retweets are treated as regular feed posts for consistency
- The original comment data is cached in the retweet post for performance
- Media from comments is properly displayed in the retweet preview
- The implementation follows the same pattern as post retweets for consistency
