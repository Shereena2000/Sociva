## 🚨 Important Notes

### **1. Firebase Rules Must Be Deployed**
Without deployed rules, you'll get "permission denied" errors. **This is the #1 issue.**

### **2. Company Must Be Registered & Verified**
The screen only shows for verified companies. Check:
```dart
companyVm.hasRegisteredCompany && companyVm.isCompanyVerified
```

### **3. Job Detail Screen**
Currently navigates to job detail screen with JobModel as argument. Make sure your job detail screen accepts this:
```dart
// In JobDetailScreen
final JobModel job = ModalRoute.of(context)!.settings.arguments as JobModel;
```

### **4. intl Package**
Required for date formatting. Run `flutter pub get` after setup.
