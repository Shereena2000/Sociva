# Image Cache Bug Fix - Same Image Showing on PageView Swipe

## Problem Identified
From the console logs, we confirmed:
- ✅ Both images load successfully (different URLs)
- ✅ PageView swipe gesture works (page changes detected)
- ❌ Same image displays on both pages (Flutter image cache bug)

**Root Cause:** Flutter's global `ImageCache` was caching the first image and serving it for both pages, even though they had different URLs and unique keys.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Clear Image Cache on Init**
**File:** `lib/Features/post/view/post_detail_screen.dart`

Added cache clearing in `initState()`:
```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  // Clear image cache to ensure fresh images
  imageCache.clear();
  imageCache.clearLiveImages();
}
```

This ensures that when you open the post detail screen, any previously cached images are cleared, forcing Flutter to load fresh images.

### 2. **RepaintBoundary Isolation**
Wrapped each PageView item in a `RepaintBoundary`:
```dart
return RepaintBoundary(
  key: ValueKey('page_$index'),
  child: Container(
    ...
  ),
);
```

`RepaintBoundary` tells Flutter to render each page independently, preventing them from sharing rendering resources or cached pixels.

### 3. **Disabled Gapless Playback**
Added `gaplessPlayback: false` to each `Image.network`:
```dart
Image.network(
  mediaUrl,
  gaplessPlayback: false, // Prevents image reuse
  ...
)
```

This prevents Flutter from reusing the previous image while loading the new one.

### 4. **Multiple Unique Keys**
Each image now has THREE levels of unique keys:
- RepaintBoundary: `ValueKey('page_$index')`
- Container: Has explicit dimensions
- Image: `ValueKey(mediaUrl)` - based on full URL

### 5. **Enhanced Debug Logging**
Added URL logging to verify different images are being requested:
```
🏗️ Building image at index 0
📸 URL: https://res.cloudinary.com/.../uqfkyf61rldn1zvhp8ic.jpg
✅ Image 0 loaded successfully

🏗️ Building image at index 1
📸 URL: https://res.cloudinary.com/.../ooj5lanqgifqblbpw93n.jpg
✅ Image 1 loaded successfully
```

## How to Test

1. **IMPORTANT: Do a full restart** (not hot reload/restart):
   - Stop the app completely
   - Restart it fresh
   - This ensures the image cache is truly cleared

2. **Navigate to:** Menu → Saved Feeds

3. **Tap on a saved feed** with 2 photos

4. **Swipe through the images**

5. **Check the console** - you should now see:
   - Different URLs being logged for each image
   - Both images loading successfully
   - Page changes working

## Expected Behavior

### On Screen:
- **Image 1:** Shows the first image (e.g., uqfkyf61rldn1zvhp8ic.jpg)
- **Swipe left**
- **Image 2:** Shows a DIFFERENT image (e.g., ooj5lanqgifqblbpw93n.jpg)
- **Page indicators** (white dots) change to show which page you're on

### In Console:
```
🖼️ Building PostDetailScreen:
   Media URLs count: 2
   Current page: 0
   Media 0: .../uqfkyf61rldn1zvhp8ic.jpg
   Media 1: .../ooj5lanqgifqblbpw93n.jpg
   🏗️ Building image at index 0
   📸 URL: https://res.cloudinary.com/.../uqfkyf61rldn1zvhp8ic.jpg
   ✅ Image 0 loaded successfully
   🏗️ Building image at index 1
   📸 URL: https://res.cloudinary.com/.../ooj5lanqgifqblbpw93n.jpg
   ✅ Image 1 loaded successfully
📄 Page changed to: 1
```

## If It Still Doesn't Work

If you still see the same image after these changes, we'll need to use the `cached_network_image` package which has better cache control. Let me know and I'll implement that solution.

## Technical Explanation

### Why This Happened

Flutter's `Image.network` uses a global `ImageCache` that stores images by their `ImageProvider`. The problem was:

1. First image loads → cached by ImageProvider
2. PageView builds second page
3. Even though the URL is different, Flutter's widget recycling + image cache was serving the cached image
4. The key alone wasn't enough because the cache is managed at a lower level

### Why This Fix Works

1. **Clearing cache** ensures no stale images exist
2. **RepaintBoundary** isolates rendering of each page
3. **gaplessPlayback: false** prevents image reuse during loading
4. **Multiple unique keys** ensure Flutter treats each widget as completely separate

## Files Modified

- `lib/Features/post/view/post_detail_screen.dart`
  - Added `initState()` with cache clearing
  - Wrapped images in `RepaintBoundary`
  - Added `gaplessPlayback: false`
  - Added URL logging for debugging

## Alternative Solutions (If Needed)

If the current fix doesn't work, we can:

1. **Use `cached_network_image` package**
   - Better cache control
   - Explicit cache keys
   - More reliable for this use case

2. **Custom ImageProvider**
   - Create a custom provider with forced cache invalidation

3. **Force reload on page change**
   - Listen to `onPageChanged` and force image reload

Let me know the results after testing! 🚀
