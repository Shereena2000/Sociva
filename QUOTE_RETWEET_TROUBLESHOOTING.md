## ✅ What I've Fixed

### 1. **Added Debug Prints**
Added comprehensive logging to track exactly where the process gets stuck:

**In `retweet_bottom_sheet.dart`:**
- 🔄 Starting quote retweet...
- 📝 Creating quote with comment: [your comment]
- ✅ Quote retweet created successfully!
- ❌ Error creating quote retweet: [error]

**In `post_repository.dart`:**
- 🔍 createQuotedRetweet: Starting...
- ✅ createQuotedRetweet: User ID: [uid]
- ✅ createQuotedRetweet: Generated post ID: [postId]
- 📤 createQuotedRetweet: Saving to Firestore...
- ✅ createQuotedRetweet: Saved to Firestore successfully
- 🔁 createQuotedRetweet: Adding to retweets array...
- ✅ createQuotedRetweet: Added to retweets array
- 🎉 createQuotedRetweet: Complete!

### 2. **Improved Error Handling**
- Extended error message display duration to 3 seconds

## 🧪 How to Debug

### **Step 1: Run the App in Debug Mode**
```bash
flutter run
```

### **Step 2: Try Quote Retweet**
1. Open the app
2. Find a post
3. Tap retweet button (🔁)
4. Tap "Quote"
5. Type a comment
6. Tap "Post"

### **Step 3: Check the Console/Logcat**

Look for these debug prints in order:

**✅ Expected Flow (Success):**
```
🔄 Starting quote retweet...
📝 Creating quote with comment: This is my comment
🔍 createQuotedRetweet: Starting...
✅ createQuotedRetweet: User ID: abc123
✅ createQuotedRetweet: Generated post ID: xyz789
📤 createQuotedRetweet: Saving to Firestore...
✅ createQuotedRetweet: Saved to Firestore successfully
🔁 createQuotedRetweet: Adding to retweets array...
✅ createQuotedRetweet: Added to retweets array
🎉 createQuotedRetweet: Complete!
✅ Quote retweet created successfully!
```

**❌ If It Gets Stuck:**

Check where the prints stop. This tells you exactly where the issue is:

#### **Scenario A: Stops at "Saving to Firestore..."**
```
📤 createQuotedRetweet: Saving to Firestore...
[STUCK HERE - NO MORE PRINTS]
```

**Problem**: Firestore write permission issue or network problem

**Solutions**:
1. Check internet connection
2. Check Firestore rules
3. Verify user is authenticated

#### **Scenario B: Stops at "Adding to retweets array..."**
```
✅ createQuotedRetweet: Saved to Firestore successfully
🔁 createQuotedRetweet: Adding to retweets array...
[STUCK HERE - NO MORE PRINTS]
```

**Problem**: Issue updating the original post's retweet array

**Solutions**:
1. Check if original post still exists
2. Check Firestore rules for update permission
3. Verify original post ID is correct

#### **Scenario C: Shows Error Message**
```
❌ createQuotedRetweet: Error - [error message]
❌ Error creating quote retweet: [error message]
```

**Problem**: Specific error occurred

**Solutions**:
1. Read the error message
2. Check if it's a permission error
3. Check if it's a network error
4. Check if it's a data validation error

## 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1: Firestore Permission Denied**

**Symptoms:**
```
❌ Error: [firebase_firestore/permission-denied]
```

**Solution:**
Check your Firestore rules. You need:

```javascript
// In firestore.rules
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /posts/{postId} {
      // Allow authenticated users to create posts
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      
      // Allow users to update posts they own or retweet
      allow update: if request.auth != null;
      
      // Allow anyone to read posts
      allow read: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

### **Issue 2: Network Timeout**

**Symptoms:**
- Dialog stuck with loading spinner
- No error message
- Prints stop at "Saving to Firestore..."

**Solution:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Try again with better connection
3. Check Firebase console for outages

### **Issue 3: User Not Authenticated**

**Symptoms:**
```
❌ createQuotedRetweet: User not authenticated
```

**Solution:**
1. Make sure user is logged in
2. Check Firebase Auth status
3. Try logging out and back in

### **Issue 4: Empty Comment**

**Symptoms:**
- Red snackbar: "Please add a comment"
- Dialog doesn't close

**Solution:**
- Type at least one character in the comment field
- Don't just press space (it trims whitespace)

## 🎯 Testing Checklist
