# Follow Feature Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the complete implementation of the Follow/Followers feature with Firebase integration for the social media app.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Core Functionality
- ✅ Follow/Unfollow users
- ✅ Real-time follower count
- ✅ Real-time following count
- ✅ Follow status tracking
- ✅ Firebase data persistence
- ✅ Automatic count updates

### 2. Firebase Structure

#### Collections Created:
```
follows/
  └── {followerId}_{followingId}
      ├── followerId: string
      ├── followingId: string
      └── followedAt: timestamp

users/
  └── {userId}
      ├── followersCount: number
      └── followingCount: number
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:

1. **`lib/Features/profile/follow/model/follow_model.dart`**
   - Model representing follow relationships
   - Contains followerId, followingId, and followedAt timestamp

2. **`lib/Features/profile/follow/repository/follow_repository.dart`**
   - Complete Firebase integration for follow operations
   - Methods included:
     - `followUser(targetUserId)` - Follow a user
     - `unfollowUser(targetUserId)` - Unfollow a user
     - `isFollowing(targetUserId)` - Check follow status
     - `isFollowingStream(targetUserId)` - Real-time follow status
     - `getFollowingList()` - Get users current user follows
     - `getFollowersList()` - Get users following current user
     - `getFollowersCount(userId)` - Get follower count
     - `getFollowingCount(userId)` - Get following count

### Files Modified:

1. **`lib/Features/profile/create_profile/model/user_profile_model.dart`**
   - Added `followersCount` field (int, default: 0)
   - Added `followingCount` field (int, default: 0)
   - Updated `toMap()`, `fromMap()`, and `copyWith()` methods

2. **`lib/Features/profile/create_profile/repository/profile_repository.dart`**
   - Updated `createOrUpdateProfile()` to initialize follow counts to 0

3. **`lib/Features/profile/profile_screen/view_model/profile_view_model.dart`**
   - Added `FollowRepository` instance
   - Added `_isFollowing` state variable
   - Added `_isFollowActionLoading` state variable
   - Added `checkFollowStatus()` method
   - Added `toggleFollow()` method
   - Updated `initializeProfile()` to check follow status
   - Updated `resetProfileState()` to reset follow states

4. **`lib/Features/profile/profile_screen/view/ui.dart`**
   - Updated stats to show real follower/following counts from user profile
   - Updated Follow button to work with `toggleFollow()` method
   - Added loading state for follow button
   - Button text changes based on follow status ("Follow" / "Following")

## How It Works

### Following a User:
1. User clicks "Follow" button on another user's profile
2. `toggleFollow()` is called in ProfileViewModel
3. `followUser()` in FollowRepository:
   - Creates a follow document in `follows` collection
   - Increments `followersCount` for target user
   - Increments `followingCount` for current user
   - All done in a Firebase batch transaction
4. Profile is refreshed to show updated counts
5. Button changes to "Following"

### Unfollowing a User:
1. User clicks "Following" button
2. `toggleFollow()` is called
3. `unfollowUser()` in FollowRepository:
   - Deletes follow document from `follows` collection
   - Decrements `followersCount` for target user
   - Decrements `followingCount` for current user
   - All done in a Firebase batch transaction
4. Profile is refreshed
5. Button changes to "Follow"

### Viewing Profile:
- When viewing own profile: Shows follower/following counts
- When viewing other user's profile: Shows their counts + Follow/Following button
- Counts update in real-time as users follow/unfollow

## Firebase Security Rules (Recommended)

Add these rules to your Firebase Firestore security rules:

```javascript
// Follow collection rules
match /follows/{followId} {
  // Anyone can read follow relationships
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  
  // Users can only create follows where they are the follower
  allow create: if request.auth != null 
    && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.followerId;
  
  // Users can only delete their own follows
  allow delete: if request.auth != null 
    && request.auth.uid == resource.data.followerId;
}

// User collection rules
match /users/{userId} {
  // Anyone can read user profiles
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  
  // Users can update their own profile
  allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
  
  // Allow follower count updates from follow operations
  allow update: if request.auth != null 
    && (request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys()
        .hasOnly(['followersCount', 'followingCount']));
}
```

## Usage Example

```dart
// Navigate to another user's profile
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => ProfileScreen(userId: 'otherUserId'),
  ),
);

// The profile will automatically:
// 1. Load user's profile with follower/following counts
// 2. Check if current user is following them
// 3. Show appropriate button state (Follow/Following)
// 4. Allow toggling follow status with one tap
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create a new user account
- [ ] Navigate to another user's profile from a post
- [ ] Click "Follow" button
- [ ] Verify follower count increases on target user
- [ ] Verify following count increases on current user
- [ ] Click "Following" button to unfollow
- [ ] Verify counts decrease correctly
- [ ] Check Firebase console for correct data structure
- [ ] Test with multiple users following each other
- [ ] Verify real-time updates

## Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:
1. Followers/Following list screens
2. Follow notifications
3. Mutual follow detection (Friends)
4. Follow suggestions based on network
5. Private accounts (require approval)
6. Block user functionality
7. Remove follower functionality

## Notes

- All follow operations use Firebase batch writes for atomicity
- Counts are stored denormalized for performance
- Follow status is checked on profile load
- Real-time streams available for follow status updates
- Error handling included for all operations
