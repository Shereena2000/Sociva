# Firebase Follow Feature Setup Guide

## 🚀 Quick Setup

The follow feature has been fully implemented! Here's what you need to know:

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Database Structure (Automatic)
The app will automatically create the following Firebase collections:

```
Firestore Database:
│
├── users/
│   └── {userId}
│       ├── name: string
│       ├── username: string
│       ├── bio: string
│       ├── profilePhotoUrl: string
│       ├── followersCount: number (NEW)
│       ├── followingCount: number (NEW)
│       ├── createdAt: timestamp
│       └── updatedAt: timestamp
│
└── follows/
    └── {followerId}_{followingId}
        ├── followerId: string
        ├── followingId: string
        └── followedAt: timestamp
```

### 2. Features Working

✅ **Follow/Unfollow Functionality**
- Tap "Follow" button on any user's profile
- Instantly follow/unfollow with one tap
- Button changes to "Following" when you follow someone

✅ **Real-time Counts**
- Follower count updates immediately
- Following count updates immediately
- Synced across all devices in real-time

✅ **Profile Integration**
- Current user's profile shows their own stats
- Other users' profiles show their stats + Follow button
- Counts displayed in profile header

✅ **Firebase Persistence**
- All data stored in Firebase Firestore
- Atomic operations (batch writes)
- Data consistency guaranteed

## 📱 How to Use

### As a User:

1. **View Another User's Profile:**
   - Tap on any post's profile picture or username
   - You'll see their profile with follower/following counts

2. **Follow Someone:**
   - Tap the "Follow" button
   - Button changes to "Following"
   - Their follower count increases
   - Your following count increases

3. **Unfollow Someone:**
   - Tap the "Following" button
   - Button changes back to "Follow"
   - Counts decrease appropriately

4. **View Your Own Profile:**
   - See your follower and following counts
   - See total posts count
   - Edit profile or add status

## 🔥 Firebase Setup (If Not Already Done)

If you haven't set up Firebase, make sure you have:

1. **Firebase Project Created**
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Your project should already be configured

2. **Firestore Database Enabled**
   - Should be enabled (you're already using it for posts)

3. **Authentication Enabled**
   - Should be enabled (you're already using it)

## 🔒 Security Rules (IMPORTANT)

Add these rules to your Firebase Firestore Security Rules to secure the follow feature:

### Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    // Existing users rules
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow update: if request.auth != null && 
        (request.auth.uid == userId || 
         request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys()
           .hasOnly(['followersCount', 'followingCount']));
      allow delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // NEW: Follow relationships rules
    match /follows/{followId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.followerId &&
        followId == request.auth.uid + '_' + request.resource.data.followingId;
      allow delete: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.followerId;
    }
    
    // Existing posts, statuses, comments rules...
    // (keep your existing rules for other collections)
  }
}
```

## 📊 Monitoring Follow Data

### View in Firebase Console:

1. **Check Follows Collection:**
   - Go to Firestore Database
   - Look for `follows` collection
   - Each document is formatted as: `{followerId}_{followingId}`

2. **Check User Counts:**
   - Go to `users` collection
   - Click on any user document
   - See `followersCount` and `followingCount` fields

## 🧪 Testing the Feature

### Test Scenario 1: Basic Follow
```
1. Create/Login with User A
2. Navigate to User B's profile (from a post)
3. Tap "Follow" button
4. Verify:
   ✓ Button changes to "Following"
   ✓ User B's follower count = 1
   ✓ User A's following count = 1
   ✓ Document created in follows/{userA_uid}_{userB_uid}
```

### Test Scenario 2: Unfollow
```
1. From User B's profile (while following)
2. Tap "Following" button
3. Verify:
   ✓ Button changes to "Follow"
   ✓ User B's follower count = 0
   ✓ User A's following count = 0
   ✓ Document deleted from follows collection
```

### Test Scenario 3: Multiple Followers
```
1. Create/Login with multiple users
2. Have each user follow User A
3. Verify:
   ✓ User A's follower count increases correctly
   ✓ Each follower's following count = 1
   ✓ Multiple documents in follows collection
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Permission Denied" Error
**Solution:** Update Firebase Security Rules (see section above)

### Issue: Counts Not Updating
**Solution:** 
- Check Firebase connection
- Verify user is authenticated
- Check console for errors

### Issue: Follow Button Not Working
**Solution:**
- Ensure you're viewing another user's profile (not your own)
- Check that ProfileViewModel is properly initialized
- Verify Firebase rules allow the operation

### Issue: Counts Show as 0
**Solution:**
- Existing users might not have count fields
- They will be added automatically on first follow/unfollow
- Or manually add them in Firebase Console

## 💾 Database Queries Being Made

The app makes these Firebase queries:

1. **On Profile Load:**
   - Get user profile (includes counts)
   - Check if current user follows this user

2. **On Follow:**
   - Batch write:
     - Create follow document
     - Increment target user's followersCount
     - Increment current user's followingCount

3. **On Unfollow:**
   - Batch write:
     - Delete follow document
     - Decrement target user's followersCount
     - Decrement current user's followingCount

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- **Denormalized Counts:** Follower/following counts are stored directly on user documents for fast reads
- **Indexed Queries:** Follow lookups use compound document IDs for O(1) access
- **Batch Operations:** All follow/unfollow actions use atomic batch writes
- **No N+1 Queries:** Counts don't require counting collection documents

## 🎯 What Happens Next?

The feature is **ready to use**! 

1. Run the app
2. Navigate to any user's profile from a post
3. Start following users!

The Firebase database will automatically create the collections and documents as users interact with the feature.
