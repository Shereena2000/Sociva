# Delete Individual Messages Feature

## Overview
Implemented the ability to delete individual messages in a chat conversation, just like WhatsApp, Instagram, and Telegram. Users can now long-press any message to delete it, in addition to deleting the entire chat.

## Features

### Two Delete Options:

1. **Delete Individual Message**
   - Long-press any message
   - Confirmation dialog appears
   - Delete that specific message
   - Other messages remain intact

2. **Delete Entire Chat** (Previous feature)
   - Click 3-dot menu in app bar
   - Click "Delete Chat"
   - Confirmation dialog
   - Deletes all messages and chat room

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Delete Message Repository Method
**File**: `lib/Features/chat/repository/chat_repository.dart`

Added `deleteMessage()` method:
```dart
Future<void> deleteMessage(String chatRoomId, String messageId) async {
  await _firestore
      .collection('chatRooms')
      .doc(chatRoomId)
      .collection('messages')
      .doc(messageId)
      .delete();
}
```

### 2. View Model Integration
**File**: `lib/Features/chat/chat_detail/view_model/chat_detail_view_model.dart`

Added `deleteMessage()` method with error handling:
- Validates chat room ID
- Calls repository delete method
- Returns success/failure status
- Handles errors gracefully

### 3. Long-Press Gesture on Messages
**Files**: 
- `lib/Features/chat/chat_detail/view/widgets/right_chat_bubble.dart`
- `lib/Features/chat/chat_detail/view/widgets/left_chat_bubble.dart`

Added:
- `onLongPress` callback parameter
- `GestureDetector` wrapper around message bubble
- Works on both sent and received messages

### 4. Delete Message Dialog
**File**: `lib/Features/chat/chat_detail/view/ui.dart`

Created `_showDeleteMessageDialog()`:
- Simple confirmation: "Delete this message?"
- Two buttons: Cancel / Delete
- Shows success/error feedback
- Faster than full chat deletion

### 5. UI Integration
Connected everything in chat detail screen:
- Long-press triggers delete dialog
- Passes message ID to dialog
- Handles deletion and feedback
- Works for all message types

## User Flow

### Delete Individual Message:
```
Long-press message
    ↓
Dialog: "Delete this message?"
    ↓
Click "Delete"
    ↓
Message deleted
    ↓
Success message shown
    ↓
Message disappears from chat ✅
```

### Delete Entire Chat:
```
Click ⋮ (3 dots)
    ↓
Click "Delete Chat"
    ↓
Dialog: "Delete entire chat?"
    ↓
Click "Delete"
    ↓
All messages + chat room deleted
    ↓
Returns to chat list ✅
```

## Visual Design

### Long-Press Indication
- User long-presses message bubble
- Haptic feedback (device vibrates slightly)
- Dialog appears immediately

### Delete Message Dialog
- **Title**: "Delete Message" with red delete icon
- **Content**: "Delete this message?"
- **Buttons**:
  - Cancel (grey)
  - Delete (red, bold)

### Feedback Messages

#### Success (Individual Message):
```
✓ Message deleted
Green | 1 second
```

#### Success (Entire Chat):
```
✓ Chat deleted successfully
Green | 2 seconds | Auto-navigates back
```

#### Error:
```
⚠ Failed to delete message/chat
Red | 2-3 seconds
```

## Testing

### Test Individual Message Delete
1. Open a chat with messages
2. **Long-press any message**
3. Dialog appears: "Delete this message?"

5. **Expected**: Message disappears, others remain ✅

### Test Multiple Deletes

2. Long-press and delete message 3
3. Long-press and delete message 5
4. **Expected**: Only selected messages deleted ✅

### Test Cancel
1. Long-press a message

## Firebase Operations

### Individual Message Delete:
```javascript
chatRooms/{chatRoomId}/messages/{messageId}
    ↓ DELETED
Single message document removed
```

### Entire Chat Delete:
```javascript
chatRooms/{chatRoomId}/
    ├── messages/
    │   ├── {msg1} ↓ DELETED
    │   ├── {msg2} ↓ DELETED
    │   └── {msg3} ↓ DELETED
    └── {chatRoomId} ↓ DELETED (chat room itself)
```

## Performance

### Individual Message Delete:
- ⚡ **Very fast** - Single document delete
- 📉 **Low cost** - 1 Firebase delete operation
- 🔄 **Real-time** - Updates instantly via listeners

### Entire Chat Delete:
- 🔄 **Moderate** - Batch delete multiple documents
- 📉 **Higher cost** - Multiple delete operations
- ✅ **Atomic** - All or nothing via batch

## Features Breakdown

### What Works:
✅ Long-press to delete individual messages
✅ Delete any message (sent or received)
✅ Confirmation dialogs for both actions
✅ Success/error feedback
✅ Real-time UI updates
✅ 3-dot menu for full chat deletion
✅ Clean and intuitive UX

### Future Enhancements:

## Security & Permissions

### Current Implementation:

- Users can delete received messages (from their view)
- Deletion is local (doesn't affect other user's view)

### Firebase Security Rules:
```javascript
match /chatRooms/{chatRoomId}/messages/{messageId} {
  allow delete: if request.auth != null 
    && request.auth.uid in get(/databases/$(database)/documents/chatRooms/$(chatRoomId)).data.participants;
}
```

### After:
