# Job Posting Feature Implementation

## Overview
Complete MVVM implementation of the Job Posting feature using Provider for state management. This feature allows verified companies to post job listings to Firebase Firestore.

## Architecture Decision: Separate `jobs` Collection

### Why Not a Subcollection?
After analyzing the project structure and database design document, I chose to implement **jobs as a separate top-level collection** rather than a subcollection of companies.

### Reasoning:
1. **Public Content Pattern**: Jobs are public content that needs global search (like posts)
2. **Better Querying**: Enables filtering by location, type, skills across ALL companies
3. **Job Seeker UX**: Users can search jobs without knowing company IDs
4. **Scalability**: Better performance for complex queries (employment type, work mode, job level, location)
5. **Consistency**: Follows the existing pattern where posts are top-level (not subcollections of users)

### Firebase Structure:
```
Firestore:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ companies/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {companyId} - Company details
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ jobs/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {jobId}
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ companyId (links to company)
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ userId (who posted)
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ jobTitle
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ experience
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vacancies
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ location
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ roleSummary
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ responsibilities: []
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ qualifications: []
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requiredSkills: []
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ employmentType
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workMode
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ jobLevel
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ isActive
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ createdAt
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ updatedAt
```

## Files Created

### 1. Model Layer
**File**: `lib/Features/jobs/add_job_post/model/job_model.dart`
- Complete job model with all required fields
- Firebase serialization (toMap/fromMap)
- copyWith method for updates

### 2. Repository Layer
**File**: `lib/Features/jobs/add_job_post/repository/job_repository.dart`
- Firebase CRUD operations
- Job filtering by company, user, employment type, work mode, job level, location
- Search functionality
- Soft delete (deactivate) and hard delete options

### 3. View Model Layer
**File**: `lib/Features/jobs/add_job_post/view_model/add_job_view_model.dart`
- Extends ChangeNotifier (Provider pattern)
- Text controllers for all fields
- Dynamic list management (add/remove responsibilities, qualifications, skills)
- Form validation
- Company verification check
- Loading states and error handling

### 4. View Layer
**File**: `lib/Features/jobs/add_job_post/view/ui.dart`
- Stateless widget using Consumer<AddJobViewModel>
- Dynamic UI updates with Provider
- Add/remove items from lists in real-time
- Working dropdowns for Employment Type, Work Mode, Job Level
- Error display with dismiss functionality
- Loading state with progress indicator
- Success feedback with SnackBar

### 5. Dependency Injection
**Updated**: `lib/Settings/helper/providers.dart`
- Registered AddJobViewModel as ChangeNotifierProvider

### 6. Firebase Security Rules
**Updated**: `firestore.rules`
- Added security rules for `jobs` collection
- Only authenticated users can read jobs
- Only job owners can create/update/delete their jobs
- Company verification enforced in app logic

## Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ Form Fields
- Job Title (text input)
- Experience (text input)
- Number of Vacancies (numeric input)
- Location (text input)
- Role Summary (multiline text)

### ‚úÖ Dynamic Lists
- **Responsibilities**: Add/remove with dedicated UI components
- **Qualifications**: Add/remove with checkmark icons
- **Required Skills**: Add/remove as chips with dismiss buttons

### ‚úÖ Dropdowns (Working)
- Employment Type: Full-time, Part-time, Internship, Contract, Freelance
- Work Mode: Remote, On-site, Hybrid
- Job Level: Entry Level, Mid Level, Senior Level

### ‚úÖ Validation
- All required fields checked
- Minimum 1 vacancy required
- At least 1 responsibility required
- At least 1 qualification required
- At least 1 skill required
- Company registration and verification check

### ‚úÖ State Management
- Loading states during submission
- Error messages with dismiss functionality
- Success feedback
- Form clearing after successful submission

### ‚úÖ Security
- User authentication required
- Company ownership verification
- Company must be verified to post jobs
- Firebase security rules enforce ownership

## How It Works

### 1. User Opens Add Job Screen
```dart
AddJobPostScreen() // Stateless widget
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Consumer<AddJobViewModel> // Provider
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ UI updates automatically on viewModel changes
```

### 2. User Fills Form
- Text fields update view model via controllers
- Dropdowns update view model via setters
- Dynamic lists managed via add/remove methods

### 3. User Adds List Items
```dart
// Example: Adding a responsibility
viewModel.addResponsibility("Manage team of developers")
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Validates input is not empty
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Adds to responsibilities list
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Clears controller
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Calls notifyListeners() ‚Üí UI updates
```

### 4. User Submits Form
```dart
viewModel.publishJob()
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sets loading state
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Validates all fields
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Gets current user (Firebase Auth)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Fetches user's company
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Verifies company is registered & verified
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Creates JobModel with all data
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Saves to Firebase Firestore
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Shows success message
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Clears form
```

## Usage Example

```dart
// In your app
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => AddJobPostScreen()),
);

// The view model is automatically available via Provider
// No need to pass it manually
```

## Firebase Data Example

```json
{
  "id": "job123",
  "companyId": "company456",
  "userId": "user789",

## Testing Checklist

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Model serialization (toMap/fromMap)
- [x] Repository CRUD operations
- [x] View model state management
- [x] UI with Provider consumer
- [x] Dynamic list management
- [x] Form validation
- [x] Firebase security rules

- [ ] Add multiple skills
- [ ] Test all dropdown options
- [ ] Test form validation errors
- [ ] Test without company registration

## Code Quality

### ‚úÖ Follows Project Standards
- MVVM architecture pattern
- Provider for state management
- Stateless widget (no StatefulWidget)
- Proper error handling
- Loading states
- Form validation
- Clean code structure
- Separation of concerns
- Firebase integration
- Security rules

### ‚úÖ Best Practices
- TextEditingControllers properly disposed
- notifyListeners() called on state changes
- Async operations handled correctly
- User feedback (loading, errors, success)
- Input validation before submission
- Business logic in view model (not in UI)
- Repository pattern for data access
- Model layer for data structures

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No company registered" error
**Solution**: User must register a company first via company registration screen

### Issue: "Company not verified" error
**Solution**: Company verification is auto-approved in current implementation (line 364 in company_registration_view_model.dart). If manual verification needed, update this logic.

### Issue: Job not appearing in Firestore
**Solution**: 
1. Check Firebase console for errors
2. Verify Firebase rules are deployed
3. Check user authentication
4. Verify company exists for user

### Issue: Form validation fails
**Solution**: Ensure all required fields are filled and at least one item is added to each dynamic list (responsibilities, qualifications, skills)
